# crowsi-incident-coordinator

Track an incident through containment, recovery, monitoring and closure using explicit evidence.

## What you can do

- Validate a requested incident transition.
- Produce a reviewable coordination plan.

## Current scope

The coordinator models transitions. External containment and recovery actions require separately authorized adapters.

Package distribution is not activated by this documentation. Use the checked-in source and the declared dependency versions; published availability must be verified separately.

## Getting started

Install Rust 1.97 or newer and make the declared dependencies available. Use the configured private registry when a dependency is not distributed publicly. Run from this repository:

```sh
cargo test --locked
```
